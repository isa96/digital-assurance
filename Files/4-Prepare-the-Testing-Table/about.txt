4: Prep the Testing Table
Serious business. Analyse the information and perform the audit.

# Background Information
Great, you did it. Thanks to you, the CIO provided us with everything we need to perform the ERP authorisation process audit. Jonathan is already thinking about the next steps, here’s what you need to do.

# Task Brief
Check out the email from Jonathan.

"""
Hello,
I'd like you to review all information the CIO provided. Start with the IT Access Control Policy and assess if everything is covered.

After that, please proceed with the audit as follows - I've provided you with a testing table that contains an example:

1)  Check if, based on user authorization requests, employees have been assigned with appropriate authorizations or if authorizations have been removed if they left ShieldGruppe.
2)  Check the password settings against the policy provided by the CIO.

While doing this audit keep in mind the overall objective of this special project and what you have identified during the first part of the
project.

After completing this audit please prepare the testing table so that potential insights or findings are highlighted and ready for my review.

Thanks,
Jonathan

This experience is self-paced. However, Jonathan is completing the review in 1 hour and needs your valuable input. We recommend you spend no more than that completing this task.
